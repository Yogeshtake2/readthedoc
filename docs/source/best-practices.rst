9.Best Practices for Users
=================

To maximize the effectiveness and integrity of the Moodle Proctoring plugin, users should adhere to the following best practices:
Prepare the Environment:
Ensure a well-lit and quiet space for taking quizzes to minimize distractions and provide clear visibility for the webcam.
Position the camera at eye level to ensure a clear view of the face.
Test Technology in Advance:
Prior to the quiz, test the webcam and microphone functionality to confirm they are working properly.
Check your internet connection for stability to avoid interruptions during the exam.
Follow Instructions:
Read and follow all instructions provided by the instructor regarding proctoring settings and requirements.
If prompted, complete any pre-quiz identity verification steps promptly and accurately.
Avoid Suspicious Behavior:
Refrain from leaving the camera view or switching tabs during the quiz, as this may trigger warnings.
Ensure that no unauthorized materials are present in the testing area, as the plugin will monitor for any potential cheating attempts.
Communicate with Instructors:
If you encounter any issues during the quiz (e.g., technical difficulties), inform the instructor immediately if possible.
After the quiz, feel free to ask for feedback or clarification on any warnings that may have been issued.
Maintain Privacy:
Understand your rights regarding data privacy and the storage of captured images. Familiarize yourself with the institutionâ€™s data retention policies.
Review Results:
After the exam, check your results and feedback through the standard Moodle channels. While you won't have access to captured images, instructors can provide insights into your performance and any flagged behavior.
